# Parallax-Website

A parallax website is a dynamic and visually engaging design approach that creates an illusion of depth and movement as users scroll through the webpage. The key feature of a parallax website is the differential scrolling speed of various elements, providing a layered effect. This effect is achieved by strategically moving background and foreground elements at different rates, creating a sense of perspective and immersion. As users scroll down, the elements appear to move independently, adding a three-dimensional quality to the webpage. Parallax scrolling is often used to enhance storytelling, showcase products, or convey a brand's identity. It captivates users' attention, encouraging them to explore the content in a more interactive and immersive manner.
